# covid19-stats-tracker
Developed a COVID-19 stats tracking React app, specifically for India (and not all the countries around the globe), using one of the many COVID-19 stats API: It fetches pandemic related data for all the states/union territories of India (total no. of cases, no. of active cases, no. of recovered patients and the no. of deaths caused in each region of India)
